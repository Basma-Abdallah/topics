I assumed that not allowed deleting category wheras it has related topics .
I didn't delete bookmark from the topic details or even from index , i used it to display that the user in the same session read that book brfore and marked it as read.
I left a copy of my database topics.sql with the project to import data from it .
I added active filed in DB in users table to control which user can access dashboard even if he/she made email verification ; active filed  for user who registered from registration form active =0 until admin change from dashboard.
I created username :admin and password :123456789 to login easily
